   - `domains` is an empty vector of `Domain` objects.
   - `bonusQuestions` is an empty vector of `BonusQuestion` objects.

6. Read bonus questions from "bonus.txt":
   - Read question text.
   - Read four answer options.
   - Read the correct option.

   - Read question text.
   - Read four answer options.
   - Read the correct option.
   - Create a `Question` object and add it to the appropriate `Domain` in the `domains` vector.

8. Close the input files ("questions.txt" and "bonus.txt").

9. Display a welcome message for the quiz.

10. Enter a loop for domain selection:
    - Display a menu of available domains and an option to exit.
    - Prompt the user to choose a domain (1 to the number of available domains) or exit (0).
    - If the user chooses to exit, display a goodbye message and exit the program.

11. If the user selects a domain:
    - Increment the `Domain::num` counter.
    - Get the selected `Domain` object based on the user's choice.
    - Conduct the regular quiz:
      - Display the domain name.
